                          <h4 className="text-center">Our Motivation</h4>
                          We are a modern and innovative support system created
                          to provide support to those who want to excel in their
                          career of network marketing, politics, health,
                          teaching etc. Talking about network marketing which is
                          our main nitch, the average person just by hearing the
                          name ‘network marketing” wouldn’t want to give a
                          listening ear. However, it has been proven that most
                          people actually give it a chance when they are guided
                          to understand the basics about the industry. So in an
                          attempt to know why many people hate network
                          marketing, we found out that many people from the
                          first sight don’t like the name network marketing
                          because they know very little or nothing about it. All
                          they will tell you is “network marketing is about
                          buying and selling products , bringing 2 people to
                          bring 2 people…” etc. And this can be traced from the
                          fact that most companies, team leaders, individuals in
                          network marketing don’t have a good mastery and hence
                          don’t provide necessary professional support and
                          training. Reasons why many adventurers, first timers,
                          darers who have little or no results in this industry
                          keep painting a negative image and impressions about
                          network marketing even when they are in a good and
                          genuine company. Again The most disturbing part of it
                          is that the rise of ponzy schemes, scams and fake
                          network marketing companies is alarming. Reasons why
                          we have more victims who ofcourse don’t appreciate the
                          industry because of their negative experiences. Very
                          few companies have systems that help them to do things
                          right. Dream Institute for Professionalism(DIP) was
                          formed to solve the above mentioned challenges. DIP is
                          an innovative modern support system which provides
                          coaching and mentorship through expertise tools. We
                          believe through DIP we will redefine the industry and
                          give it a positive image that it deserves.
