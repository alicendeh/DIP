              Years of personal experience have proven that the saying by John
              C. Maxwell “Everything rises and falls on leadership” is hardly an
              exaggeration. Leadership is at the center of the growth of every
              institution, organizations, governments, networks and of course
              network marketing just to name a few. DIP is a product conceived
              in the quest to provide solutions to these leadership crisis in
              some of the aforementioned sectors with keen interest in but not
              limited to network marketing.
